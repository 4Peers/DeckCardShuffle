# DeckCardShuffle
/* Note to Self */
This was an interesting inpromptu interview code exersise
the original code was incomple during the ~30 min timeframe. Was mainly missing a Randomizer. 
With more thought added a some structure improvements and Object Orientation extention.
I could not let it go, so I spent a bit more time ~30 min or so to comlete it.
