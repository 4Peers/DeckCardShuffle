# DeckCardShuffle
/* Note to Self */
This was an interesting inpromptu interview code exersise.
The original code was incomple during the ~30 min timeframe, mainly missing a Randomizer. 
With more thoughts, I  added some structure improvements and Object Orientation extention.
I could not let it go, so I spent a bit more time ~30 min or so to complete it.
